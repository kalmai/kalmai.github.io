            During week three at Tech Elevator we worked with File i/o which was really cool. Up until this point all I've really been working with is static HTML and terminal. It seems so useful how you could manipulate files in the system so easily with File i/o. Other than that, well not really on a side-note, but we started out first capstone project. This year it wasn't a vending machine like in previous cohorts for Tech Elevator, but a POS system for a catering service. I guess these things are basically the exact same thing, but you don't really feed $100.00 bills into a vending machine for a coke haha. At first, I really struggled to simply read the file and add the values to a list which we would eventually use for the whole project. But after some assistance from our instructor we were able to get the foundation of our program down. Then I accidentally coded the whole thing haha..... It isn't perfect, but I can say that I'm happy it is done so I don't have to lie awake thinking of how to approach a part of the project haha. Anyways, apparently SQL is a lot easier than Java so I guess I'm looking forward to this. But at the same time maybe I'll be bored not working on homework until midnight everyday... Oh well, guess we will see.
