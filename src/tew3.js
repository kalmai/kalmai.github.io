            This week at Tech Elevator we received news regarding whether we would be learning on campus or not. Of course we won't be able to, I agree wholeheartedly with this decision since I don't really think I would be comfortable with putting myself and my family at risk of exposing ourselves to covid-19. Anyways, in regards to concepts learned in class this week there was actually a lot of stuff we covered. I think I was most excited to learn testing this week since it was something that challenged me to think differently. We also covered inheritance and polymorphism which I struggled with especially during our pair work we were assigned. After getting help from an instrutor, my partner and I were able to come together and finish the work on Saturday without any problems. I was really excited about this because perhaps it means I'm understanding the material more and more. Besides progress with the cohort, I received my first 'ergonomic' keyboard in the mail this week and I've really bee enjoying it thusfar. I should be receiving the same layout in the next month or so and I'm excited to use some of the switches I've had lying around for monthssssss. The only negative thing about this board is that it lacks some programability which I'm not really used to compared to my Salamander. Perhaps I'll learn some of the hash-code or whatever language they use for QMK and just flash the HEX file directly next weekend. It really seems like these side projects are all getting pushed to the weekend since Tech Elevator takes up so much of my time, I hardly find myself turning on my gaming PC anymore besides to grab up free game keys from the Epic Game Store (this week was Borderlands 2!). Finally, I'm really starting to enjoy using VIM/the VIM emulator in Eclipse to program since not using my mouse really helps with my RSI in my shoulder. Can't wait to continue learning test-driven development next week!
