            For week 5 we started learning sql. Thus far we’ve learned to create, manipulate, and travel databases. So far, these concepts have been a lot easier to pick up. This is probably because sql queries really aren’t that hard it seems… but I think next week we’re supposed to start incorporating java with what we’ve learned this week. While me and my pair partner were finishing up Fridays homework, she pointed out that we had our second capstone next week already…<br/><br/>

I don’t really know if we can really learn databases in just one and a half weeks, but perhaps databases really are as easy they seem…
