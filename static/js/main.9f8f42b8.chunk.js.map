I'm not really a great writer, not am I the best at conveying ideas as of right now. But I've created some programs during the cohort and I've made them viewable below. I'd really like to incorporate more cool JS into this page, but really blogs are pretty lame. Maybe I'll convert the JAVA programs into JS and leave buttons on here...<br /><br />\n\nAnways, this week I've learned after extensive use of Bash to push, pull, and create/move/remove files. I've always enjoyed not touching a mouse so this has been super useful. The idea that you need to give variables significant names was once more reinforced. My friend who really got me into programming didn't appreciate me naming variables 'sixtyNine' and my lack of indentation which I'm learning to appreciate more now. We also worked on logic and then after that for loops. Finally we moved into eclipse to create and run actual Java programs which I've provided the compiled Java files below. I will admit that I didn't solve some of the math problems myself, but I am proud that I was able to take the formulas online and convert it into working code. I've just learned that running class files doesn't really work that well so I didn't compile the programs and just provided them below. I'm really looking forward to week two!</div>\n        </div>\n    );\n}\n\nexport default tew1;","import React from 'react';\nimport './tew1.css'\n\nfunction SCalice() {\n    return (\n        <div id=\"tew1Container\">\n            <h2>Alice by <a href=\"https://switchcouture.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Swith Couture</a></h2>\n            <div className=\"te-image\">\n                <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/lOFnL19.jpg\" alt=\"acrylic alice keyboard\" />\n            </div>\n            <p></p>\n            <div>\n                <ul>\n                    <li>Parts</li>\n                    <ul>\n                        <li>PCB: Mechlovin's Adelais RGB</li>\n                        <li>case</li>\n                        <li>Zealios V2 67g</li>\n                        <ul>\n                            <li>lubed with Tribosys 3203</li>\n                            <li>filmed with TX films: clear</li>\n                        </ul>\n                        <li>zeal stabilizers</li>\n                        <li>EPBT 9009</li>\n                        <li>custom USB Mini cable by Zap Cables</li>\n                    </ul>\n                    <li>Changes</li>\n                    <ul>\n                        <li>after switching from PK's USB C cable, had to make USB Mini cable</li>\n                    </ul>\n                    <li>Possible changes</li>\n                    <ul>\n                        <li>want to fix Mechlovin PCB</li>\n                        <li>will swap out PCB for Sneakbox's hotswap PCB to use as switch testing bed</li>\n                    </ul>\n                    <li>Keymap coming soon...</li>\n                </ul>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    );\n}\n\nexport default SCalice;","import React from 'react'\nimport Header from './header'\nimport TEW1 from './tew1.js'\nimport SCalice from './sc-alice.js'\n\nfunction Home() {\n    return (\n        <div>\n            <Header title=\"landing page title\" />\n            <div className=\"tew1\">\n                <TEW1 />\n            </div>\n            <div>\n                <SCalice />\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    );\n}\n\nexport default Home","import React from 'react';\nimport './tew1.css'\n\nfunction tew2(){\n    return(\n        <div id=\"tew1Container\">\n            <h2>Tech Elevator: 2</h2>\n            <div className=\"te-image\">\n            <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/VUJ3RrB.jpg\" alt=\"desktop\" />\n            </div>\n            <p></p>\n            <div>\n            For week two at Tech Elevator we continued to learn about ways to deal with data including Set, Map, and List. I really enjoyed learning these methods since it allows us to process so much data in a sometimes more efficient way. In regards to efficiency, I asked our instructor why we wouldn't just use Set/Map/List all the time instead of arrays and if I'm remembering correctly it has something to do with the way that Java compiles and arrays eat up less memory. Anyways, after I guess we finished learning a few more methods (substring is the answer to everything), we moved on to some more difficult concepts that I am still struggling with. To be honest, last week there were somethings I didn't fully grasp immediately so I imagine having more time to play with classes, getters, and setters everyday will help a lot. Either way, I'm really looking forward to bolstering my knowledge of classes and of course whatever is in store for next week.\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    );\n}\n\nexport default tew2;","import React from 'react';\nimport './tew1.css'\n\nfunction tew3(){\n    return(\n        <div id=\"tew1Container\">\n            <h2>Tech Elevator: 3</h2>\n            <div className=\"te-image\">\n            <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/VUJ3RrB.jpg\" alt=\"desktop\" />\n            </div>\n            <p></p>\n            <div>\n            This week at Tech Elevator we received news regarding whether we would be learning on campus or not. Of course we won't be able to, I agree wholeheartedly with this decision since I don't really think I would be comfortable with putting myself and my family at risk of exposing ourselves to covid-19. Anyways, in regards to concepts learned in class this week there was actually a lot of stuff we covered. I think I was most excited to learn testing this week since it was something that challenged me to think differently. We also covered inheritance and polymorphism which I struggled with especially during our pair work we were assigned. After getting help from an instrutor, my partner and I were able to come together and finish the work on Saturday without any problems. I was really excited about this because perhaps it means I'm understanding the material more and more. Besides progress with the cohort, I received my first 'ergonomic' keyboard in the mail this week and I've really bee enjoying it thusfar. I should be receiving the same layout in the next month or so and I'm excited to use some of the switches I've had lying around for monthssssss. The only negative thing about this board is that it lacks some programability which I'm not really used to compared to my Salamander. Perhaps I'll learn some of the hash-code or whatever language they use for QMK and just flash the HEX file directly next weekend. It really seems like these side projects are all getting pushed to the weekend since Tech Elevator takes up so much of my time, I hardly find myself turning on my gaming PC anymore besides to grab up free game keys from the Epic Game Store (this week was Borderlands 2!). Finally, I'm really starting to enjoy using VIM/the VIM emulator in Eclipse to program since not using my mouse really helps with my RSI in my shoulder.

Up until this point all I've really been working with is static HTML and terminal. It seems so useful how you could manipulate files in the system so easily with File i/o. Other than that, well not really on a side-note, but we started out first capstone project. This year it wasn't a vending machine like in previous cohorts for Tech Elevator, but a POS system for a catering service. I guess these things are basically the exact same thing, but you don't really feed $100.00 bills into a vending machine for a coke haha. At first, I really struggled to simply read the file and add the values to a list which we would eventually use for the whole project. But after some assistance from our instructor we were able to get the foundation of our program down. Then I accidentally coded the whole thing haha..... It isn't perfect, but I can say that I'm happy it is done so I don't have to lie awake thinking of how to approach a part of the project haha. Anyways, apparently SQL is a lot easier than Java so I guess I'm looking forward to this. But at the same time maybe I'll be bored not working on homework until midnight everyday...

Thus far we’ve learned to create, manipulate, and travel databases. So far, these concepts have been a lot easier to pick up. This is probably because sql queries really aren’t that hard it seems… but I think next week we’re supposed to start incorporating java with what we’ve learned this week. While me and my pair partner were finishing up Fridays homework, she pointed out that we had our second capstone next week already…<br/><br/>\n\nI don’t really know if we can really learn databases in just one and a half weeks, but perhaps databases really are as easy they seem…\n\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    );\n}\n\nexport default tew5;","import React from 'react';\nimport './tew1.css'\n\nfunction tew6(){\n    return(\n        <div id=\"tew1Container\">\n            <h2>Tech Elevator: 6</h2>\n            <div className=\"te-image\">\n            <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/VUJ3RrB.jpg\" alt=\"desktop\" />\n            </div>\n            <p></p>\n            <div>\n            For week 6 we learned how to use the database queries that we were writing last week in Java. This was by far the hardest part of the whole database module which ended up being the hardest part of the capstone project. Yeah, I wasn’t expected the capstone so early. Nor that it was going to be content that only spanned two weeks. Well then again, I haven’t really been paying too much attention to overall schedule, just dealing with problems when they present themselves.<br/><br/>\n\nFor the capstone, we wrote another CLI. I think that’s what we’re going to be doing for the next capstone too. Anyways, for this we just used some sql queries to get data like usual, but in java. My partner and I got the DAO’s and JDBCDAO’s written during the week and started the CLI, but like I predicted, we horribly underestimated how much work the menu to run the CLI would take. We spent maybe nine hours on Sunday busting it out with only one hour to spare. Unfortunately, there is a kinda major bug in it and we didn’t do any of the bonus requirements regrettably. But, I do feel like I was able to learn some of the material better which I’m happy about.\n\n\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    );\n}\n\nexport default tew6;","import React from
