I've always enjoyed not touching a mouse so this has been super useful. The idea that you need to give variables significant names was once more reinforced. My friend who really got me into programming didn't appreciate me naming variables 'sixtyNine' and my lack of indentation which I'm learning to appreciate more now. We also worked on logic and then after that for loops. Finally we moved into eclipse to create and run actual Java programs which I've provided the compiled Java files below. I will admit that I didn't solve some of the math problems myself, but I am proud that I was able to take the formulas online and convert it into working code. I've just learned that running class files doesn't really work that well so I didn't compile the programs and just provided them below.

I really enjoyed learning these methods since it allows us to process so much data in a sometimes more efficient way. In regards to efficiency, I asked our instructor why we wouldn't just use Set/Map/List all the time instead of arrays and if I'm remembering correctly it has something to do with the way that Java compiles and arrays eat up less memory. Anyways, after I guess we finished learning a few more methods (substring is the answer to everything), we moved on to some more difficult concepts that I am still struggling with. To be honest, last week there were somethings I didn't fully grasp immediately so I imagine having more time to play with classes, getters, and setters everyday will help a lot. Either way, I'm really looking forward to bolstering my knowledge of classes and of course whatever is in store for next week."))};var d=function(){return n.a.createElement("div",{id:"tew1Container"},n.a.createElement("h2",null,"Tech Elevator: 3"),n.a.createElement("div",{className:"te-image"},n.a.createElement("img",{src:"https://i.imgur.com/VUJ3RrB.jpg",alt:"desktop"})),n.a.createElement("p",null),n.a.createElement("div",null,"This week at Tech Elevator we received news regarding whether we would be learning on campus or not. Of course we won't be able to, I agree wholeheartedly with this decision since I don't really think I would be comfortable with putting myself and my family at risk of exposing ourselves to covid-19. Anyways, in regards to concepts learned in class this week there was actually a lot of stuff we covered. I think I was most excited to learn testing this week since it was something that challenged me to think differently. We also covered inheritance and polymorphism which I struggled with especially during our pair work we were assigned. After getting help from an instrutor, my partner and I were able to come together and finish the work on Saturday without any problems. I was really excited about this because perhaps it means I'm understanding the material more and more. Besides progress with the cohort, I received my first 'ergonomic' keyboard in the mail this week and I've really bee enjoying it thusfar. I should be receiving the same layout in the next month or so and I'm excited to use some of the switches I've had lying around for monthssssss. The only negative thing about this board is that it lacks some programability which I'm not really used to compared to my Salamander. Perhaps I'll learn some of the hash-code or whatever language they use for QMK and just flash the HEX file directly next weekend. It really seems like these side projects are all getting pushed to the weekend since Tech Elevator takes up so much of my time, I hardly find myself turning on my gaming PC anymore besides to grab up free game keys from the Epic Game Store (this week was Borderlands 2!). Finally, I'm really starting to enjoy using VIM/the VIM emulator in Eclipse to program since not using my mouse really helps with my RSI in my shoulder.

Up until this point all I've really been working with is static HTML and terminal. It seems so useful how you could manipulate files in the system so easily with File i/o. Other than that, well not really on a side-note, but we started out first capstone project. This year it wasn't a vending machine like in previous cohorts for Tech Elevator, but a POS system for a catering service. I guess these things are basically the exact same thing, but you don't really feed $100.00 bills into a vending machine for a coke haha. At first, I really struggled to simply read the file and add the values to a list which we would eventually use for the whole project. But after some assistance from our instructor we were able to get the foundation of our program down. Then I accidentally coded the whole thing haha..... It isn't perfect, but I can say that I'm happy it is done so I don't have to lie awake thinking of how to approach a part of the project haha. Anyways, apparently SQL is a lot easier than Java so I guess I'm looking forward to this. But at the same time maybe I'll be bored not working on homework until midnight everyday...

We spent maybe nine hours on Sunday busting it out with only one hour to spare. Unfortunately, there is a kinda major bug in it and we didn\u2019t do any of the bonus requirements regrettably.
